LameXP is a graphical user-interface (front-end) for various of audio encoders: It allows you to convert your audio files from one audio format to another one in the most simple way.Despite its name, LameXP is not only a front-end for the LAME MP3 encoder, but supports a wide range of output formats, including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, AAC/MP4, FLAC, AC-3 and Wave Audio. The number of supported input formats is even bigger! Furthermore LameXP not only runs on Windows XP, but also on Windows 7, 8 and 10 as well as many other operating systems.

## Notes

- If your anti-virus program complains about the LameXP program file, it is because it has been "packed" by UPX. [More info...](http://lamexp.sourceforge.net/doc/Manual.html#anti-virus-notes)
