Nicotine+ is a graphical client for the Soulseek peer-to-peer network.

Nicotine+ aims to be a pleasant, free and open source (FOSS) alternative to the official Soulseek client, providing additional functionality while keeping current with the Soulseek protocol.

Nicotine+ uses GTK for its graphical user interface, and is written in Python.
