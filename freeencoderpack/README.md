This pack includes every natively supported free encoder binary for use with the Converter foobar2000 component. The binaries are conveniently installed into a subfolder of the foobar2000 installation folder.

Current versions of foobar2000 will automatically recognize these encoders and no longer ask you for encoder binary location.

## Features

Included encoders:

- FLAC
- Ogg Vorbis
- Opus
- Musepack
- WavPack
- AAC + Apple Lossless (qaac) - requires iTunes to be installed (read more...)
- AAC (fhgaacenc) - requires Winamp to be installed (read more...)
- Apple Lossless (refalac)
- MP3 (LAME)

## Notes

- Included AAC encoders require external applications providing actual encoding functionality
