 A freeware system profiler (system monitor) application that detects the central processing unit, RAM, motherboard chipset, and other hardware features of a modern personal computer, and presents the information in one window:

## Features

- Processor name and number, codename, process, package, cache levels.
- Mainboard and chipset.
- Memory type, size, timings, and module specifications (SPD).
- Real time measurement of each core's internal frequency, memory frequency.

## Notes

- You might need to use `--ignore-checksums` option when installing this package due to the fact that vendor overwrites historic download locations. Automatic updater will release new version with choco fix notation when that happens, but the push of this package can fail due to the longstanding bug with chocolatey gallery.
